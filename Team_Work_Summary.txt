Designed overall system architecture following MVC pattern with clear separation between model layer (Badge, Reader, Resource, User, Profile classes), business logic layer (AccessProcessor, TimeFilter, ProfileManager), and presentation layer (all UI components). Established project structure with proper package organization (com.bigcomp.accesscontrol.{db,model,arp,ui,sim,log,util}), created batch scripts for compilation and execution, configured MySQL database with proper schema, and implemented event-driven architecture using PropertyChangeListener patterns. Initiated testing framework and performance considerations for scalability with 300 badges and 400 badge readers.
